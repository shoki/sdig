Fri Apr  4 08:56:07 MST 2003 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 * Final documentation tweaks for release

Mon Mar 24 14:27:09 MST 2003 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - swc: removed.  It wasn't being maintained, anyway.

Mon Mar 24 14:06:11 MST 2003 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - Makefile: DESTDIR is now supported for packaging.  All files are
   now installed with the local install command, and respect the usual
   autoconf things like prefix.  The man pages are now installed.

   Note: since the prefix is now /usr/local, your configuration path
   will be /usr/local/etc by default.  If this isn't what you want,
   use configure --sysconfpath to change it back to /etc.

 * autoconf added - configure is now used to prep the tree for builds.

 - sdig: reworked debug levels, cleaned up const usage

 - sdig: added checks for malloc/strdup calls

Tue Feb 18 15:31:39 MST 2003 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - sdig: added a check for SNMPv2-MIB::sysName.0 when printing
   Switch: details.  If this is found, it will be included on that
   line.  Consider this an incentive to set good data in your equipment.

Thu Dec  5 13:48:35 MST 2002 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - sdig: added HOSTINFO support to allow extra details to be printed 
   about a host before the router check starts.

Thu Dec  5 13:29:46 MST 2002 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - nbname: dropped.  It's beyond the scope of this project.
   Use nmblookup -A <host> to find what you need.

   Support for printing the host's NetBIOS name (or anything else)
   will be handled by the upcoming HOSTINFO directive.

Thu Dec  5 13:26:01 MST 2002 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - snmpget, sdig: reworked to make Net-SNMP happy.

Wed Dec  4 18:12:14 MST 2002 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 * The Makefile now looks for net-snmp-config, so UCD-SNMP support is
   effectively retired at this point. 

Mon Aug 12 16:54:04 MDT 2002 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - sdig: fixed the -m search-by-MAC mode.  It was still trying to use
   the human-readable long format while the internals were changed to
   a packed binary format.

0.30:

Mon Jul 22 20:21:36 MDT 2002 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - nbname: moved the resolve() call down after where root powers are
   dropped just in case someone manages to overflow the resolver

Mon Jul 22 20:19:25 MDT 2002 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - sdig: rewrote a lot of the guts again.  There's now an internal
   snmpget function, and the external snmpget binary is no longer needed.

   The old 3com-specific hack of "unit x, port y" is now gone since
   sdig now fetches the port description from the switch itself.
   This is usually a lot more informative anyway.

0.20:

Wed Apr  3 23:09:55 MST 2002 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 * Final cleanups for release.  It's time to push this one out and
   get working on cleaning up some of the cruft.  It's apparent that
   other people are actually using this now, so things need to be
   improved. 

Sun Jan  6 06:10:17 MST 2002 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - sdig.8, sdig.conf.5: man pages created.

Thu Nov 22 07:07:51 MST 2001 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - sdig: the debug code now has multiple levels so using -d once 
   doesn't give you all the really messy unimportant stuff.  To see
   that, use several - the really ugly ones are hiding down at 5 and 6.

 - sdig: massive overhaul - the tangle of code in main is gone.  There
   are now a bunch of functions that have obvious names so the flow is
   easier to follow.

 - sdig: PORTINFO switched to PORTDESC throughout, as it should be.
   Reported by Ernie Oporto.

0.11:

Fri May 18 13:03:42 MDT 2001 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - sdig: updated code/docs to reflect WINS is now optional

Fri May 18 12:57:23 MDT 2001 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - swc: root privileges are dropped after the bind to a low port is done

Fri May 18 12:50:09 MDT 2001 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - swc: fixed to work with Net-SNMP tools

Fri May 18 12:42:08 MDT 2001 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - sdig: cleaned up the switch probe loop logic and output routines

Fri May 18 12:31:30 MDT 2001 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - sdig: "<MAC> not found on switch <IP>" is now suppressed unless you
   run in verbose mode.

Fri May 18 12:26:25 MDT 2001 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - sdig: help text and mac example updates

Fri May 18 11:24:49 MDT 2001 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - sdig: in-addr reverse resolution is now performed when available.

 * Trivia note: DNS came around rather late since this program was
   originally written to track down Windoze boxes, and they were all
   in WINS.  It seems strange for a Unix program to do WINS first and
   DNS second, but you scratch the itch before going for completeness.

Fri May 18 10:51:32 MDT 2001 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - sdig: here's how DNS and WINS and direct port 137 queries work:

   - Hostname given: try DNS, then WINS, to get an IP address
   - IP address given: no forward resolution necessary (obviously)

   Regardless, attempt a NBNAME query if configured.

Thu May 17 12:21:13 CDT 2001 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - sdig: DNS lookups are now supported.  WINS is still used if DNS fails.

Thu May 17 11:58:42 CDT 2001 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - swc: dumped the SNMPGET/SNMPSET #defines for now, and just rely on
   them being in the path.  A config file is just too much bulk for this
   program, which is supposed to be lightweight.

 - swc/sdig: moved line parsing code out into common

Thu May 17 09:57:51 MDT 2001 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - swc: new helper program.  This was a separate project so it's not
   really integrated yet.  You can use it to turn ports on and off 
   without going through the complicated telnet or http interfaces.
   I use it locally with cron to enable and disable ports that are out
   in areas of schools that aren't supervised after hours.

Wed May 16 18:22:52 MDT 2001 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - Everything should now work with Net-SNMP, at the expense of not
   working with the older CMU SNMP snmpget.  You'll need to upgrade to
   Net-SNMP if you were previously using the CMU version.

Wed May 16 18:02:59 MDT 2001 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - sdig: started switching the code over to the Net-SNMP snmpget format
   which doesn't say things like "Hex:" and "OCTET STRING:".

Wed May 16 17:14:11 MDT 2001 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - sdig: pow() is no longer used, so math.h and -lm are gone.

 - The MAC table's location is now configured with MACTABLE <path>
   in the sdig.conf.  If you're upgrading from 0.10, be sure to
   add this to your file.

Wed May 16 16:58:59 MDT 2001 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - This file is now called CHANGES.

 - The MAC table is no longer provided in the package since it's bulky
   and redundant for existing users.  It's available on the main web 
   site - http://www.exploits.org/sdig/

 - sdig now supports -d to switch on debug mode.  This currently exposes
   the popen activities, with more in the future planned.

0.10 - 4 August 2000

 - Initial release just to get it out there.  This program has been
   used where I work for almost a year now.  In the past week it has
   been cleaned up a great deal in order to remove most of the hardcoded
   items that would be a major annoyance to other users.

   There's no telling where this program may go, but it should be
   interesting.
