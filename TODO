TODO list
=========

Things that need to happen sooner or later...

 - Other portability changes

   If sdig doesn't work properly on your favorite OS, it's probably 
   because I don't run it here.  Mail me and we'll make it work.
   If I can make UPS software run everywhere, then something as simple
   as this shouldn't be that hard.


 - Use remaining system.* information to enhance the output:

   system.sysDescr.0
   system.sysLocation.0
   system.sysContact.0

Then there are the blue sky items, such as:

 - perhaps some kind of database plugin functionality

 - -m <MAC> should have a way to go through all of the routers in 
   the config file if you really have no idea where a host is

 - Come up with some way to parallelize the switch query stage -
   some of my locations have up to 10 switches and it can take awhile
   to find the right one

 - While doing MAC-based searches, it should also hit the routers and
   try to reverse it back to IP address(es) for extra tracking help
