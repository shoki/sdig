Switch Digger install docs
==========================

This program needs some helpers to be effective.  Go get them and build
them first, then come back to this document to do sdig itself.

1. Net-SNMP package (* required *)

   Get it from http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/

   Note: The older CMU SNMP package may not work.

2. Samba (optional)

 - Get it from a mirror via http://www.samba.org/

 - Build it and make a note of where 'nmblookup' is installed

Now you can build sdig with the usual procedure.  Once it's done compiling,
install it with 'make install' and edit the config file to suit your
system.  The important ones are ROUTER and SWITCH.  You can add further
details later.
