Release notes for 0.40

The build system now uses autoconf, so you can do the usual tricks with 
--prefix and --sysconfdir to customize your build.  Be aware that the 
default configuration will look for sdig.conf in /usr/local/etc, while 
previous versions assumed /etc.

DESTDIR is now supported for packaging purposes.

SNMPv2-MIB::sysName.0 is now printed when available for switches.

nbname has been dropped.  If you still need additional NetBIOS type data, 
write a script to call Samba's nmblookup, then set it as your HOSTINFO 
command.

UCD-SNMP support is essentially gone.  You can probably still make it work 
if you're determined to use the old libraries, but it will require 
renaming a bunch of includes and variable types.

The -m switch to search by MAC addresses works again.
